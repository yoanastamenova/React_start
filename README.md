# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



# STEPS TO FOLLOW WHEN WORKING WITH REACT 

1. ` npm create vite@latest `

2. Choose options such as:
    - project name, 
    - react (as library), 
    - js + swc (as language) 
    and finally run  
    ` cd new directory `
    ` npm install `
    ` npm run dev `

3. We can now open the provided port as in our browser 
` localhost:5173 `
